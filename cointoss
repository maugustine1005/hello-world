<h4>Toss a coin</h4>
<p>Lets say you toss a coin; and lets call it a fair coin (in that it has an equal chance of landing on either side).  
Lets also call the two sides of the coin Heads and Tails or just H and T for short.
As we toss the coin, keep track of how many heads and tails we get.  
To do this we can write H or T for each toss of the coin. 
After ten tosses we can count up the Hs and Ts.  
How many of each did you get?  How many times did you toss your coin?
Continue tossing the coin; after ten more tosses how many heads and tails do you get? 
There are two numbers we can determine.  
The first is what should you expect is the proportion of heads you should see. 
Next, what is the proportion of heads that you actually count during your experiement.    
Since a coin has two pssible outcomes and each are possible; you should expect to see see half are heads. 
Therefore 50% is the expected proportion.   
To get the actual proportion, count the total tosses and count the heads, divide the numbers of heads by the total to get the actual proportion.

<h4>Questions<h4/>
<p>Here is a set of flips recorded.  {HHTHT THHTH} How many flips and how many heads? So what is the proportion of heads?
What is the probability of the next flip being a head?
As you continue flipping coins, what do you notice about the actual proportion and the expected proportion of heads?
What is the proportion of tails?
If you add the proportion of heads and tails what do you get and why?
