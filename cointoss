Lets say you toss a coin.  Lets call it a fair coin (in that has an equal chance of landing on either side).  Lets also call the two sides of the coin Heads and Tails or just H and T.
As we flip the coin, now lets keep track of how many heads and tails we get.  So we can write H or T for each flip of the coin. After ten flips we can count up the Hs and Ts.  How many of each did you get?
We can continue flipping coins, after ten more flips how many heads and tails do you get? 
There are two numbers you can think of.  The first is what should you expect is gte proportion of heads you should see, given that this is a fair coin. Next, what is the proportion of heads that you actually see during your experiement.
