# hello-world
Everything starts someplace

Welcome to my git hub space.  
I have been a professional programmer, analyst and statistician for the past over thirty years.
My plan is to port over python, R and other programs for future development and release.
I also plan to learn a lot and teach others.

My current project is two-fold.  Develop curriculum for high school students to understand spreadsheets; MS Excel in particular.
Secondly, introduce students to probability and statistics using Excel assignments to provide a platform for experimentation.
Each set of lessons leverages the next in a logical stepwise manner.
