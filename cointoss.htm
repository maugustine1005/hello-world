<h3>Probability</h3>
Risk, chance and probability are very much related.  
We hear these terms when we talk about which team might beat another, or whether or not it could rain tomorrow. 
Some things we know will happen, for example if you through a ball in the air, we know it will come down.  
But where exactly is somewhat random.  
Different factors, that are hard to predict will determine where the ball will fall.
This is where probobility comes in.  
You likely are familiar with probability from the randomness found in games of chance likes cards and dice.  
We will learn that randomness is everywhere.  
Probability helps us understand random events.  
Understanding probability is our first step into the world of statistics.
<h4>Toss a coin</h4>
<p>Lets say you toss a coin; and lets call it a fair coin (in that it has an equal chance of landing on either side).  
Lets also call the two sides of the coin 'Heads' and 'Tails' or just 'H' and 'T' for short.
As we toss the coin, keep track of how many heads and tails we get.  
To do this we can write 'H' or 'T' for each toss of the coin. 
After ten tosses we can count up the 'H's and 'T's.  <br/>
How many of each did you get?  <br/>
How many times did you toss your coin?<br/>
Continue tossing the coin; after ten more tosses how many heads and tails do you get? <br/>
There are two numbers we can determine.  
The first is what should you expect is the proportion of heads you should see. 
Next, what is the proportion of heads that you actually count during your experiement.    
Since a coin has two possible outcomes and each are possible; you should expect to see see half are heads. 
Therefore 50% is the expected proportion.   
To get the actual proportion, count the total tosses and count the heads, divide the numbers of heads by the total to get the actual proportion.

<h4>Questions<h4/>
<p>Here is a set of tosses recorded.  {HHTHT THHTH} How many tosses and how many heads? <br/>
  So what is the proportion of heads?<br/>
What is the probability of the next toss being a head?<br/>
As you continue tossing coins, what do you notice about the actual proportion and the expected proportion of heads?<br/>
What is the proportion of tails?<br/>
If you add the proportion of heads and tails what do you get and why?
<br/>
This leads us to our first computer exercise.

<h4>Exercise: Model a coin toss experiment in Excel</h4>
<p>Open Excel.  
<br/>
On a blank sheet, type the following in cell A1, 'Coin Toss'. <br/>
In cell A2 type '1'.<br/>
In cell B1 type 'Trial 1'. <br/>
In Cell B2, type the formula =mid("HT",int(2*rand(0)),1)<br/>
Select Cells A2 to B2 and drag them down to B21.<br/>
Then select cells B1 to B21 and drag across to K21.
